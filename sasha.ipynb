       "  \" Me and a couple of friends had been bored, when I decided we should take a walk through the woods behind my house. I didn't think much of it, as me and my friend have done it many times before. There were four of us, and we set out at about 11 o'clock at night. It was rather dark, but there was light from the moon. The weather was rather cold, as we did this in the winter. The area we walked on was game trails (trails that moose walk on) as well as trails used for mushers, runners, cross country skiiers, and that sort. We had walked about 2 miles from my house to another entrance where most people enter. On the way we had talked about unexplainable events or things such as bigfoot, and UFOs. When we reached the bridge where most people come in, one friend had smoked a cigarette. We then saw a light and decided to go on. On the way back, we heard wild dogs barking wildly, and decided to pick up the speed. It eventually became a sprint, whereafter we walked. When we walked, we continued talking about it. It was then I had realized, some thing had been following us, as well as testing us, or even harassing us. It was much earlier, I just didnt think about it. I had thought it was my friend Warren, who is sometimes clumsy. I had thought it was him who had made noises such as slipping, but it was really something throwing stuff at us. I had realized this about half way back. I asked if Warren kept slipping, when he told me it wasn't, and he thought I could have been pulling a prank. We stopped for a minute to listen when I told the others something strange was going on. We stopped, and shone a flashlight around, hearing noises such as steps, and branches moving and breaking. The leader had thought I had been playing a joke when I told him seriously, I wasn't. He decided to walk behind with me, when something threw snowballs, and nearly hit us on many occasions. It was then he realized that this was no joke, and we picked up a light jog, for most of the way. When we were almost out of the woods, we had again heard dogs, and maybe 20 ft away, the branches breaking, and again, something throwing stuff at us. By the time we left, it was about 3-3\",\n",

      "OBSERVED [' I and two of my friends were bored one night so we decided to do a little snowmachining. Though it was illegal to snowmachine in Anchorage, there were some good trails to ride on a little north of my house.  We took off at probably 11 pm, rode up the road about a quarter mile, and cut off on the trails. It had snowed about 10 inches a few days before so there was fresh snow, with no tracks.  I was leading the way for about a half hour, then we stopped and talked for a little bit.  We took off again and kept cruising on some sort of game trail that led to an opening in the woods.  I rode off into the opening with my friends following about fifty yards behind me.  I came over this little mound and saw strange tracks leading to this spot in the snow where it looked like something had pushed aside some snow and layed down.  I figured it was just a moose or something.  But I followed the tracks over the next small hill and as I came down the far side my headlight pointed right on the back of a bigfoot.  It was only about 10 to 12 feet in front of me.  It was running in the opposite direction.  I slammed on the brakes because I was scared out of my mind.  It continued to run away, jumped over a dead log covered in snow and disappeared into a group of trees and into the darkness.  I was so surprised and scared I quickly turned around and rode back toward my friends. I met them back by the first mound and said \"We need to get out of here,\"  and rode back towards my house.  When I told them about it back near my house, they laughed and told me it was probably a bear or someone in the woods.  But I was 100% positive that is was not a bear or anything else. The way it was running through the deep snow made me sure that it wasn\\'t anything human.  For a long time I was made fun of and everyone told me I was crazy so I didn\\'t like talking about it.  ', \" Me and a couple of friends had been bored, when I decided we should take a walk through the woods behind my house. I didn't think much of it, as me and my friend have done it many times before. There were four of us, and we set out at about 11 o'clock at night. It was rather dark, but there was light from the moon. The weather was rather cold, as we did this in the winter. The area we walked on was game trails (trails that moose walk on) as well as trails used for mushers, runners, cross country skiiers, and that sort. We had walked about 2 miles from my house to another entrance where most people enter. On the way we had talked about unexplainable events or things such as bigfoot, and UFOs. When we reached the bridge where most people come in, one friend had smoked a cigarette. We then saw a light and decided to go on. On the way back, we heard wild dogs barking wildly, and decided to pick up the speed. It eventually became a sprint, whereafter we walked. When we walked, we continued talking about it. It was then I had realized, some thing had been following us, as well as testing us, or even harassing us. It was much earlier, I just didnt think about it. I had thought it was my friend Warren, who is sometimes clumsy. I had thought it was him who had made noises such as slipping, but it was really something throwing stuff at us. I had realized this about half way back. I asked if Warren kept slipping, when he told me it wasn't, and he thought I could have been pulling a prank. We stopped for a minute to listen when I told the others something strange was going on. We stopped, and shone a flashlight around, hearing noises such as steps, and branches moving and breaking. The leader had thought I had been playing a joke when I told him seriously, I wasn't. He decided to walk behind with me, when something threw snowballs, and nearly hit us on many occasions. It was then he realized that this was no joke, and we picked up a light jog, for most of the way. When we were almost out of the woods, we had again heard dogs, and maybe 20 ft away, the branches breaking, and again, something throwing stuff at us. By the time we left, it was about 3-3\"]\n",

I came over this little mound and saw strange tracks leading to this spot in the snow where it looked like something had pushed aside some snow and layed down.  I figured it was just a moose or something.  But I followed the tracks over the next small hill and as I came down the far side my headlight pointed right on the back of a bigfoot.  It was only about 10 to 12 feet in front of me.  It was running in the opposite direction.  I slammed on the brakes because I was scared out of my mind.  It continued to run away, jumped over a dead log covered in snow and disappeared into a group of trees and into the darkness.  I was so surprised and scared I quickly turned around and rode back toward my friends. I met them back by the first mound and said \"We need to get out of here,\"  and rode back towards my house.  When I told them about it back near my house, they laughed and told me it was probably a bear or someone in the woods.  But I was 100% positive that is was not a bear or anything else. The way it was running through the deep snow made me sure that it wasn't anything human.  For a long time I was made fun of and everyone told me I was crazy so I didn't like talking about it.  \n",

      "OTHER STORIES: I have not heard of any other incidents in Anchorage.\n",
      "TIME AND CONDITIONS: Middle of the night. The only light was the headlight from my snowmachine.\n",

      "Follow-up investigation report by BFRO Investigator Dr. Wolf H. Fahrenbach:\n",
      "The animal was running from the approaching snowmobiles. It was running smoothly with angled elbows, totally unimpeded by the fresh snow, which was about a foot deep and still falling on top of a deeper base. It was dark brown in color, with a messy, matted coat and no perceptible neck.The area of the encounter lies near a clear-cut lane for a pipeline and is within about a mile of the Anchorage Coastal Wildlife Refuge and Potter's Marsh in wooded terrain.\n",
