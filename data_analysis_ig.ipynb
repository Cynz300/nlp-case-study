Though it was illegal to snowmachine in Anchorage, there were some good trails to ride on a little north of my house.  <BR><BR>We took off at probably 11 pm, rode up the road about a quarter mile, and cut off on the trails. It had snowed about 10 inches a few days before so there was fresh snow, with no tracks.  <BR><BR>I was leading the way for about a half hour, then we stopped and talked for a little bit.  We took off again and kept cruising on some sort of game trail that led to an opening in the woods.  I rode off into the opening with my friends following about fifty yards behind me.  <BR><BR>I came over this little mound and saw strange tracks leading to this spot in the snow where it looked like something had pushed aside some snow and layed down.  I figured it was just a moose or something.  But I followed the tracks over the next small hill and as I came down the far side my headlight pointed right on the back of a bigfoot. <BR><BR> It was only about 10 to 12 feet in front of me.  It was running in the opposite direction.  I slammed on the brakes because I was scared out of my mind.  It continued to run away, jumped over a dead log covered in snow and disappeared into a group of trees and into the darkness.  <BR><BR>I was so surprised and scared I quickly turned around and rode back toward my friends. I met them back by the first mound and said \"We need to get out of here,\"  and rode back towards my house.  When I told them about it back near my house, they laughed and told me it was probably a bear or someone in the woods.  But I was 100% positive that is was not a bear or anything else. <BR><BR>The way it was running through the deep snow made me sure that it wasn't anything human.  For a long time I was made fun of and everyone told me I was crazy so I didn't like talking about it.  </p><p><span class=field>ALSO NOTICED:</span> Some tracks in the snow, and a clearing in the fresh snow where it looked like a large animal had pushed snow aside and layed down.</p><p><span class=field>OTHER WITNESSES:</span> My two friends were snowmachining behind me but did not see it. If it had been light outside they might have seen it, but it was pitch black outside. My only light was from my snowmachine.</p><p><span class=field>OTHER STORIES:</span> I have not heard of any other incidents in Anchorage.</p><p><span class=field>TIME AND CONDITIONS:</span> Middle of the night. The only light was the headlight from my snowmachine.</p><p><span class=field>ENVIRONMENT:</span> In the middle of the woods, in a clearing covered in snow, with only small shrubs and bushes sticking out of the snow.  In the middle of the night.</p>\r\n",

If it had been a moose or large deer looking straight on, it may have look as though someone standing but that would have been identified when the creature turned and went off into the brush.

The interview resulted in the following additional information...1.  The entire sighting, from first glance to last seen, was under 30 seconds in duration. The creature was about 100 yards away when first seen, but as the sighting progressed the distance was reduced to about 20 to 30 yards.2.  The witness didn't get a good look at the creature's face or its feet.  He described the shape of the head as being a cross between that of a human and a gorilla.  The hair on the body seemed to be fairly uniform in length, about three to four inches, and was not matted or scruffy looking.3. He has no explanation for the unusual gait of the creature, and could not speculate as to the possibility of an injury or deformity that might cause it.4.  The witness says he is inclined to believe what he saw was a real non-human animal, but it was definitely not a bear. He recognizes that there is a remote chance that someone could have been carrying out a hoax, but he indicated that if it was someone in a costume it was so convincing that it would have to be a costume of Hollywood-professional quality.\"]\n",

This was the witness\\x92s first trip to Alaska, so he was focused on the road ahead, hoping to see some wildlife. The witness saw the creature on the left side of the two-lane road. It was approximately eight or nine feet tall. There didn\\x92t appear to be any distinction between the creature's head and neck. It had long arms, a short torso, and long legs.  The creature casually crossed the road in three long strides then stepped into the trees. While approaching the area where the creature crossed, the witness requested that they stop and look around, but his son was unnerved, and refused to stop. The creature was exiting from the southwest side of the road, which is the Tetlin National Wildlife Refuge. The 730,000 acre refuge stretches south from the Alcan Highway, and west from the Canadian border. Hundreds of thousands of waterfowl flock here to nest every spring.  It is also home to 44 known species of mammals.To the south, it borders the 13 million acre Wrangell-St. Elias National Park and Preserve, the largest designated wilderness in the United States.\"]\n",

      "['Ed L.is a commercial fisherman and former Air Force noncom and mechanic.The area, according to Ed, was known for its concentration of berries and black bears. The salmon run was in the early starting stage. Solid forest was estimated to be about 100 miles away. Ed did not have even a shadow of a doubt about the identity of the animal he had seen, particularly since he had previously hunted many of the large game animals of Alaska. Hair of the described appearance can be estimated to be 18-24\" long. The interest of this sighting with its rather meager contents lies in its geographical latitude. The center of Prince William Sound lies at 60 degree, 40 minutes N. Additional Alaskan sighting reports are to be found in Green (1978), and in an article in the magazine \"Alaska\" of October, 1995, pp. 25-27. Aside from reports in the Alaska Panhandle, e.g., near Hyder, Ward Cove on Prince of Wales Island, and in the Wrangell Narrows (by Bob Titmus himself), all in the vicinity of 56 degrees N., there are scattered sightings farther north. On the Alaska Peninsula, a cluster of sightings have been recorded near Chignik Lake (55 degree, 54 minutes N), Manokotak near Kulukak Bay (58', '40 N), Togiak drainage (59 N), Lake Iliamna (59', '30 N), and yet farther north near Galena, 120 miles inland from Norton Sound (64', '44 N) and Kotzebue Sound at the Arctic Circle (66', '33). All of these sites are on the coast or within ready sasquatch walking distance of it and are, consequently, moderated by the ocean. Such cannot be said for inland sightings, such as that near Fort Yukon, south of the Brooks Range, or Dawson Creek (NE British Columbia; detailed in Hunter and Dahinden, 1993). Both of these locations are exposed to the full brunt of the arctic winter. Seasonal migration would appear to be of immediate advantage in these regions as compared to the overall temperate Pacific Northwest, though unlikely to be established in view of the rarity of these events. In any case, large bulk and long hair would be of decided survival value. ']\n",

There are multiple unexposed water sources nearby. There\\'s also a power line route connecting various fields that would be used by deer.Sightings and encounters near Martin Pond could be expected, even today -- because it\\'s an unexposed water source close to a power line route through a heavily forested area that is dotted with grazing fields.  Transient deer will move along that power line route and provide reliable ambush opportunities for a predator, especially in the late Summer and early Fall.']\n",

Its head size was proportionate to the body size with the hair hanging down on the shoulders.  The witness went home, got her husband and returned to the sighting area.

TB decided to try an area where he had captured deer on his game cams. The terrain is very steep hills and valleys in north central Alabama. Down on one of these valleys lays a deep, wide creek that has a shallow, wide spot where the deer can cross without swimming.TB arrived at this spot about 2', '30 in the afternoon. He placed his stand high in the tree about 100 yds. from the deer crossing. His stand is roughly 60 yds. from the creek at its closest point. As the sun begins to fade around 4- deer come to the brush and tree line to feed. TB heard something moving through the brush at 4', '30, TB notices the lack of deer movement. This is the time of day the deer should be coming out. As it approached, crossing the last few rays of sunlight, TB could see something too dark to be a deer. Stepping into his shooting corridor was a 6-7 foot tall beast with brown hair and red tint. The creature was of slender build, with heavily defined upper leg and calf muscles.  The creature appeared to be female as breasts swung with each stride. The face was covered in hair, small ears and very large eyes; it walked purposely with a relaxed stride swinging the arms. The arms hung down around ¼ the length of the legs. Being high in the tree stand with camouflage and upwind the female didn\\x92t seem to notice TB at all. The being was coming from deep woods with limestone outcroppings. The witness was completely frightened as soon enough time had passed, TB left his stand and an arrow to head out of the woods.

The trash consisted of ribs, chicken, burgers and drink cans, etc. Around 3', '30 am on July 5, 2015 the witness was sleeping on the couch, right next to the porch. His cousin \"L\" was sleeping in the bedroom down the hall from the porch. The cousin heard it coming as she had seen and heard it before. Cousin \"L\" stated she just laid quietly in her bed, thinking \"I told him about this thing and he just laughed, so who\\x92s laughing now\". She had heard it approach before and was waiting for the brothers reaction. The dog that yelped was a small dog at the back of the mobile home. Evidently it yelped when cousin \"L\" picked the dog up and put it in bed with her. (The dog being killed that was mentioned was a cousin\\'s dog at a different location, not sure what could have killed it.)The witness stated that all the yipping little house dogs suddenly stopped their barking and went quiet. He then heard and felt the front porch groan. He sat up and cracked the blinds to see what was going on. He saw a Sasquatch come up to the porch, duck under the roof, sit down and start rummaging through the trash bags. They had left the porch light on, a 60 watt bulb, so very good visibility. As he watched this creature digging though the bags, it didn\\x92t even get up to reach other bags. The arms were thought to be 4 - 5 ft. long, the fingers were described like Snicker bars with finger nails, and the head was shaped like the back of Darth Vader\\x92s helmet. The hair was about 4 \\x96 5 inches long, the hair was colored dark brown with a hint of red. The entire back was very muscular, the feet were estimated to be at least 16 inches long, and very broad. After doing some measurements it would appear the Sasquatch was about 8 1/2 feet tall and maybe 800 lbs.  It had a very bad smell like cheese gone bad. The Sasquatch never did turn to where the witness could see the face.The witness was too scared to move, he\\x92s not sure how long the creature was there. He is sure it was at least 20 minutes. His cell phone was on a charger across the room. He didn\\x92t want to move and scare it away. When it was done it just took a leap to the ground and strode off though the yard across a 30 foot road in two strides, down a ravine and was gone.   During my visit I was shown what appears to be finger and hand prints on the trailer. The fingers start at the far left side of the trailer, with the fingers closed together, and as the Sasquatch walked toward the porch the fingers began to open until at the bedroom window it became a smudge of a hand print. The fingers and hand print were at least twice the size of mine. The hand print was smudged like it had been looking in the widow and was trying for a better grip. Photos of the prints on the trailer', \"There is a long history of sightings in the area. It\\x92s a sparsely populated area with just a few homes that are usually close together. There were more stories, but those witnesses couldn\\x92t make it the day I was there.

Regarding the wish to kill something, I explained that we have never received a report where a Bigfoot hurt anybody. That they all have their own personalities and more likely there isn't just one in the area. I suggested that they may not take lightly to one of theirs getting shot. The folks living there who had close encounters realized at how much they look like humans, and they really couldn't kill any of them.One of the children attempted to take a photo of a Sasquatch from 200 yards, here is the photo, unfortunately it is blurry and little detail is seen\", \"There is no doubt in my mind this was a real encounter.

      "['I found this witness to be very honest and credible during our long conversation regarding his sighting.  At the time he was 18 years old and was with his cousin deer hunting on some property near his home.    A tremendous ice storm had previously passed through the area, and left large tree branches on the ground.  They heard a loud \\x93pop\\x94 like an aluminum bat being hit on one of the trees or branches.  They also heard footsteps, and this caused the men to turn to look behind them.   A large creature stepped out from the tree line about 35 yds away.  It did not move after noticing them, and just stared with squinting eyes \\x93like someone does with poor vision after taking their glasses off.\\x94   It was described as having a large \\x93melon shaped head\\x94, with somewhat long, light brown hair with red highlights.  The body was covered with similar hair.   No nose or mouth was noticed.  It stood on two legs, very long but proportionate for the body which was very massive and upright, standing about 9 feet tall.  Musculature was not very noticeable due to the great amount of hair covering its body.  Its feet were not noticed, being hidden by ground foliage.  It made no further noise or movement toward the men.  He distinctly remembers a smell associated with the sighting to be similar to rotten eggs and earthy, as well as smelling like the creature hadn\\x92t bathed ever.  He distinctly remembers being extremely frightened. He and his cousin then ran away from the creature as fast as they could.  The creature did not follow.  After thinking more about the visual sighting, he feels it was probably closer to 30 seconds.  This witness was quite relieved to be able to tell his story after so many years.    Over the past 11 years, he has talked to numerous other individuals in the area who have also had similar stories to tell like his.  This witness also related an event that happened at age 21.  He was at this same area camping with his cousin and had just cooked some hamburgers.  His pet German Sheppard, who normally is quite aggressive and ferocious,  began barking and growling at something in the nearby woods for at least 20 minutes.  The dog then ran into the woods about 20 yards, and was then seen flying back out of the woods with a backward somersault, whining tremendously.   The dog ran past the men out of the camp, still whining the whole time.  They later found the dog back home.  The cousin stated he saw something large and brown, but no other description was given.

      "[\"A video of the caretaker's interview is here\", 'This report was first brought to our attention after BFRO Investigator Vince Lauria gave a lecture at a country club in Alabama. A Birmingham attorney volunteered the information that a caretaker on his land had seen a bigfoot several years ago. The attorney claimed that he had never really believed bigfoot existed until his caretaker had stated that he had seen one. The attorney commented that the man has worked for him for several decades and that he was incredibly honest. \\x93He never lied to me before, so I can\\x92t imagine him lying about something like that.\\x94 With the exchange of names and information we were able to contact the witness and hear his story.In August of 2004 the witness was driving north on private land along the Sepulga River. It was dusk, he had been plowing fields. As he turned a bend he saw a 6-7 ft black, hairy creature cross the road from right to left.  The witness said it was less than 20 feet in front of him running quickly. It looked at him, kept eye contact but never slowed down or stopped. The witness had his window down and could hear it running through the thick woods after he lost sight of it. The witness described that it had a manlike face, with very long arms. The hair was black and shaggy, and he could see the hair hanging from its hands. It was not thin, but muscular. Dark skin was visible on the face, it had a wide nose, and a conical head. When it ran, it pumped its arms. It came from the direction of the river, and appeared to be wet.The witness said he had found footprints by the river earlier in the summer and didn\\x92t know what had made them. Once he saw the bigfoot, he then realized that it had been responsible for the prints. He has not seen or heard of one before or since that summer. He told his boss and family only. The witness, his family, Investigator Vince Lauria and I went to the location of the road crossing. It is heavily wooded, bordered by the river and farm land. It is very secluded. There is a power line road that borders the property as well.Vince recalls interviewing a Native American brother and sister that saw a bigfoot on the other side of the river less than a mile away. Both of them reported having a black bigfoot run across the road in July of the same year. In both reports, the creature was running away from the river.']\n",

She observed the hair on the head being somewhat long, and the creature having a human looking face with no hair on it. It stood erect on two legs, not moving just staring directly at her. The creature held a squealing baby pig in its arms, up against its chest in a cradle like fashion. The witness and the creature had direct visual contact for 15 seconds before she broke away to run into the house. It never turned away, never broke eye contact with her.She never heard approaching footsteps or noise of any kind, indicating something had come into the neighbor's yard, though the creature was only 25 yards away from her when she observed it. The witness is a modest and honorable individual that is left with an encounter that is imprinted vividly in her mind to this day, even after 34 years. Initially hesitant to speak in great detail for fear of ridicule, she opened up to me and revealed details of this encounter after I assured her of her anonymity. Adding to her credibility is her husband, a retired police officer of 34 years. Though he jokingly told her she saw a bear, he told me when speaking to me by phone, that he knew that his wife had seen a very large creature that day that was not a bear. He said she went into a temporary shock, and by the look on her face, and manner of her speech, knew she was telling the truth. Her husband assured me of his ability to know the difference when one is telling the truth, confused, or lying, based on his years of police experience and training.\"]\n",

Here is a sketch made by the witness', 'The following can be added to this report - The hair was six to eight inches long.The hair was dark brown.There were leaves stuck in the hair on the buttocks.The head was very bulky.The huge size of the hands was the most remarkable visual noted by the witness.The right hand held what looked like a rock.  The rock was egg shaped and almost as large in diameter as a bowling ball.  The creature handled the rock as if it were a softball.The creature\\x92s movement was powerful. The estimated height was 7\\x92 6\\x94.The estimated weight was 450+ pounds.This sighting was at sunset.  The witness hit her brakes and horn when she saw the deer sprint full speed across the road.  She had never seen a deer run that fast.  As the car was stopping, she saw the creature coming to a stop near the roads edge.  The headlights started to light up the creature as it turned to its left and walked back into the pine forest.  She slowly drove forward until she was at the point where the creature entered the forest.  Her window was down and she could smell a very strong, musty odor with the power of skunk.  She could also hear the creature making deep, raspy, loud grunts.  When she looked for the source of the grunts she could see the creature about 50 feet inside the wood line facing her car.  These grunt unnerved the witness and she drove home.  I met with the witness the afternoon after the encounter where the sighting took place.  The pine forest was thick with trees from 3\\x94 to 12\\x94 in diameter.  The ground was covered with a thick layer of pine needles so no tracks could be found.  I did find deep scuff marks near the roads edge where she said the deer sprinted across the road.  We stayed road side for about an hour as it started getting dark.  There was a huge storm front moving in and lightning could be seen flashing on the horizon.  I decided to make two quick whoops to see if there would be any response.  Two seconds later there was a faint response that we both heard.  The response was of the same cadence and tone I had used.  We stayed there in the dark for about 20 minutes then left because the storms were getting closeThe witness went back to the site alone 2 days later.  She started to smell the same odor again after about 10 minutes.  The odor started getting stronger after another 2 minutes so she left and did not go back.']\n",

The friend is a law enforcement officer in a county that adjoins Cullman County.  The LEO has seen one of the animals similar to the one described by this witness. He, his father and brother have been aggressively intimidated by similar animals on their hunting land.  A few years ago he took an exceptionally good photograph of a large, man-like track left by an enigmatic primate on the property of a family member. I have had the pleasure of working closely with the friend in investigating his and other residents\\x92 reports from that area of Alabama. I spoke with the witness several times after his first call. As a result of those conversations a few more details can be added to his original report.\\x95 The first sounds that he heard before the figure came into view were yipping and barking which he thought were made by coyotes.\\x95 Those sounds were immediately followed by whooping, a loud yelling sound and loud bipedal footsteps.\\x95 He then saw a large, dark hair-covered figure \\x93walking hard\\x94 out of a draw to his left.\\x95 The figure was walking at an angle past him about seventy yards away when it turned left into thick brush to walk directly up slope toward the top of what is locally called Wilhite Mountain. \\x95 The witness stated the animal was in view for about two minutes.\\x95 He could hear the sounds of the animal\\x92s travel up the mountain for a minute or so.\\x95 The animal was \\x93dark\\x94 colored, about eight feet tall, taking long strides while leaning forward and with only moderate movement of its arms. \\x95 The animal\\x92s upper body was very wide and thick, with little tapering to the waist line, and the head appeared large.\\x95 Facial features were not noted.The witness is believed to be a credible observer and his encounter report valid.

      "['Upon speaking with the witness he was able to add the following details of the encounter not previously noted. The SUV was parked in the garage with the rear of the vehicle at the entrance of the garage. The witness saw the back upper torso, shoulders, and head of the creature. This entire time of observation was five seconds from a distance of approximately twenty five feet. There was no description of arms, lower torso, and legs as they were blocked from view by the vehicle. During this encounter there was a light on in the garage that allowed the witness to notice this detail. However, no face detail was noted, other than the absence of visible ears, because the animal was observed from behind. The witness estimates the height of his SUV at around six foot six inches. The creature in question would have been over a foot taller than the top of the SUV according to witness observation, placing the animal at around eight foot tall. As stated, after about five seconds of observation the witness ran inside.After returning outside with his son the witness noticed three footprints left on his concrete drive due to the animal walking onto the driveway from the wet grass caused by the evening rain. He describes them as looking like a man\\x92s footprint. The witness is fortunate enough to own a shoe once worn by an NBA player. The shoe in question is a size sixteen and the witness states the wet footprint wouldn\\x92t fit into the shoe. He said the width of the print stood out as being wider than the foot that would have been in the size sixteen shoes.  He also estimates the distance between the footprints at around four feet with the total distance covered in three steps at just over twelve feet.  The area around the witness\\x92 property is wooded with intermittent farms and fields. The animal would have had to cover an area of around seventy-five yards in order to reach the wood line from where the witness observed the creature.  According to the witness he was in the house about thirty seconds.I found this witness to be articulate and forthcoming and believe he is credible.  In my opinion there is land nearby that would support such animals and there is an abundance of game in the area.  The land I reference is Ft. Rucker which is where the Army trains Helicoptor pilots and hunting is off limits on this base.  ']\n",

He said it was a kind of path that connected a neighborhood with a local grocery store. This trail was bordered by woods all around which could provide plenty of cover for a large bipedal creature to come and go without detection. Also, very near the trail where the encounter occurred is the grocery store dumpster, containing thrown out food. This very well could be the reason this creature was encountered at this location.Now concerning the encounter. The witness said he remembered falling off his bike, looking up and seeing this large, brown hairy creature. He estimated that it was ten feet from him, looking directly at him when it let out a loud howl/growl that terrified him. I asked him about facial and bodily features, other than what he stated in his report. He distinctly remembered the mouth being wide open as it howled/growled, displaying human-like teeth, only larger. The howl/growl was deep yet pitched, and lasted a few seconds. He said it sounded like nothing he has ever heard. Immediately after this it turned and walked off the trail into the woods at a high rate of speed. As it moved through the woods, the witness remembers hearing branches snapping. The witness then got up, climbed on his bike and rode home as fast as he could, where he hid in his house, fearfully peeking out the window hoping the creature did not follow him home.The witness seemed very credible to me. He was clear about the details he remembered and did not try to embellish or add to it. To this day the witness has not returned to the site of the encounter. This says something to me seeing he is a veteran of the Marine Corps, and a career Firefighter. Obviously what he witnessed made quite an impact on him.']\n",

      "[\"I am quite familiar with the area where the witness had his two encounters. Having hiked in the area I can attest to the fact that it is a very rural and forested. It has an abundance of local wildlife, and many natural water sources in addition to the Coosa River. I believe these are some key factors to consider when determining the validity of this report. The witness is very familiar with this area and its wildlife. Confusing what he saw with another animal is out of the question. The only other possibility would be that it was a person, rather than a large hairy creature that the witness identified it as. I do not believe this to be the case.The witness was able to get two good looks at this creature on two separate occasions.He stated to me that the anatomy of the creature was human-like but also distinctly different. Of course it was quite a bit larger than the average man. In height and thickness, its upper torso was larger than its lower body. Its arm length was longer than a human's hanging to the knee area. Also, the position of the head was a little forward on the upper shoulder, or trapezius area, and there was no visible neck. These anatomical features are common with similar looking creatures observed by other witnesses throughout the nation. The 2nd sighting by the witness was at some length. He was able to slow down and really observe the creature in morning daylight. A key point was in the way the creature moved. He said it walked calmly and effortlessly across the highway. Looking straight ahead, never turning to view either side of the road.The final and possibly most important point in validating the witnesses sighting in my opinion is the way it went over the guard rail. Guard rails on the side of highways are around 3 feet high. Average people would have to stop or at least slow down and re- position in some way to go over it when walking. Even the tallest human would bend, lean, or shift to navigate his way over this rail. The creature did it without breaking stride, all in one motion, and effortless. Humans simply cannot do this. I have tried. In my opinion I believe the witness had two genuine encounters.\"]\n",

The son carried one board in and the witness grabbed a second board, as he did he looked out over the backyard. The outside light cast a shadow over the trees in the backyard. As he looked around he noticed a raunchy smell like something dead. Then he noticed that he had one too many trees in the yard.

The witness, a fifteen-year marine veteran, stated that he had seen a lot of things, but not once did he think of grabbing a gun and going to look for tracks. He knew what he saw. Two nights later his brother who is a pastor saw the same creature cross between his truck and a car in front of him in his headlights.

Shortly after that, a few days later, the nieces came running in screaming, saying something was after them and had been throwing rocks at them.

      "[\"I interviewed him on 7-5-06.  He guesstimated the creature as a little over 7 feet tall by comparing it with the height of the fence. It was powerfully built, had long arms, and thick, matted hair. Hair color was dark brown to gray or black. He said he was probably even closer to it than he originally stated. Possibly within 50 to 75 feet. It was running very fast and hard as it was trying to catch the deer. He did not get a look at it's face. It ran, leaning slightly forward with a great deal of arm swing. Jacob also noted that he was standing on a high patch of ground in full full view of the creature. Yet it never looked at him nor seemed to know he was there. As this occured very close to his home, I asked him about any missing pets or livestock. He says he has had some dogs turn up missing, along with an occasional goat. When the goats turn up missing he would search for them. On one such occasion he found the remains. He described it as having a broken hip, along with some internal organs, apparently ripped out.\"]\n",

There are more than 600 square miles of forest with very few roads and almost no homes from the sighting location, westward.  The witness had to hike to his fishing spot. The creek where the sighting took place is actually a long, narrow, winding man-made lake about 200 yards wide. He had been fishing in the dark for about 15 minutes when the fighting sounds started. For about 30 minutes, the two animals were running left and right about 60 yards each way as they worked their way down hill towards the witness. The sound of tree limbs being ran through and broken was accompanied with growling and hollering.  The two would stop frequently and to the witness it sounded as if they were fighting each other.  Being a mature, lifelong outdoorsman, he could tell there was no way it could be deer or humans fighting. When he could tell they were in a clearing near the waterline across from his location, he illuminated them with a powerful spot light.  The light illuminated the left side of two 7\\x92-7.5\" tall bipeds facing the same direction (90 degrees to the witness).  They had dark skin.  Their shoulders were very wide and both had large buttocks and hands.  They were very lean and muscles could be seen in action.  Both turned and sprinted away, straight uphill as fast as deer, quickly into the forest where he could still hear them running away.  Neither of the two looked at his spotlight.']\n",

The creature did not turn to look at them, but rather kept searching through the grass.  The face was not seen.

      "['I was able to speak directly with three of the witnesses involved in the incident reported. The witnesses described how they were camping on land belonging to one of the families. They had never experienced anything remotely close to what they experienced that night. While two of the witnesses left the area, two of the four stayed behind and began working on erecting a tent. It was then that they first began hearing strange sounds and began smelling a rancid odor (which persisted through much of the night). Keep in mind that these young men all grew up in the vicinity and were well used to all the sounds of the forest. These sounds were uniquely peculiar in that they sounded almost human-like. The witnesses \\x93heard something like a person\\x94 20 \\x96 30 yards away just after the sun had gone down. What they were hearing was similar to the sounds of \"someone walking around.\" It was now \\x93pitch dark.\\x94 A campfire was burning and flashlights and ATV lights were in use. The sounds began to evoke images of someone \\x93stomping around or jumping.\\x94 The two young men now found themselves getting \\x93spooked.\\x94 Whatever it was, it remained just out of sight and across the creek. Then, the two began hearing \\x93deep growls.\\x94 The young men\\'s dog, a cocker spaniel, was decidedly uncomfortable with the disquieting visitor. The witnesses remarked that the dog was extremely nervous, whiney and afraid through out the evening. When the other two witnesses arrived back on the scene, the sounds seemingly stopped. A while later, the sounds (\\x93stomping, jumping, and growling\\x94) resumed, this time all four of the young men heard them. The sounds continued for approximately 15 minutes, then the unseen entity sounded as though it jumped into the creek and began approaching the young men. At that time, the witnesses, already scared, now became defensive and began shouting (still thinking \\x96 indeed hoping it to be human) at the intruder, ordering it to not come any closer. The primary witness indicated that at that time he picked up a large rock and threw it toward the unknown and unseen harasser. The stone must have hit its target or came very close, because the unidentified tormentor shrieked and hysterically ran around the campsite, the whole time the young men hearing its loud panting and breathing. Once it stopped, the witnesses decided to end the stand off and defiantly began to approach the creature. The animal then produced a scream that \\x93sounded like a woman but much more high-pitched.\\x94 The primary witness stated that the scream was so loud that it actually made his \\x93ears hurt.\\x94 The witnesses immediately left to retrieve one of their fathers.When the witnesses returned, all activity had ceased. The father witnessed nothing of the sort that the young men had witnessed and casually dismissed the incident. The young men were still not sure of what they had encountered. The father managed to calm the young men down, and they reluctantly decided to stay the rest of the night at the campsite. I asked the witnesses why they would choose to return and stay there after having endured such a harrowing experience. The said they all lived there and knew the woods well, and that the animal could have been anything, and they believed that the game of torment was over. Into the night, the primary witness awoke to more noises, but he chose to try to ignore the sounds. He remained awake until the sun came up. When the other young men awoke the next morning, they combed the area for indications of what had tormented them during the night. The witnesses found large humanlike footprints \\x9315 \\x96 16 inches in length with five toes,\\x94 and an area where something large had created a nest with a crude, rudimentary roof of tree branches. Also in the area around the nest, they found dark hairs. Apparently they began to hear noises again, and the primary witness \\x93crept\\x94 up a small hill and peered over it, only to see a \\x93large, hairy animal\\x94 with its back facing him. The animal was at a distance of 30 \\x96 40 yards. It turned once and looked at the witness and then ran off. The witness described the creature as being \\x93dark brown,\\x94 and \\x93around seven feet tall,\\x94 with a face that \\x93looked like a gorilla.\\x94 At that time, the witness thought to himself, \\x93So this is what a bigfoot looks like.\\x94  The father came to the campsite and inspected the area. He listened to the testimony of the primary witness and looked at the tracks. He then told the young men that he believed they had been harassed by a bigfoot. ']\n",

Current forensic studies suggest that after 15 years, there would be very little left of the St. Bernard due to the natural process of decay as well as the scavenging of animals.The witness, who is very credible, has presented a case that offers the possibility of what appears to be very interesting sasquatch behavior.Editor's note (MM)\", '  This location is near a power line route.  Sightings and related incidents often occur within a short distance of power line routes. This is true in both eastern and western states. Deer and elk often move and feed under power line routes.  The trees and tall brush are cut away in these swaths, allowing berry bushes and grasses to flourish there. There is almost always a gravelled access road under power lines, but very little vehicle traffic throughout the year.']\n",

He then saw a shape back lit by the pole light. The figure was about 8ft 6 inches tall (compared to a broken branch found the next day) 3- 4 feet wide and about 500- 600 lbs. The man then drew his side arm and called out. The animal made the same sound again. He thought it might even be a person. Again the sound was repeated, alarmed the man without losing eye contact made his way to the car trunk, where he removed his rifle. It was stated that he never felt threatened. Upon the man gaining his rifle the creature backed off and retreated into the woods. The man then went into the house to retrieve a better light, upon returning with the wife and mother-in-law in tow there was nothing.

HM thought it was someone playing games, he called out \\x93Hey\\x94, the creature then ran into the tree line. At the time no real visual description was seen just a tall bulky figure.

Due to heavy leaf litter no casts were made.The second sighting took place March of 2013 around 9 pm. HM had been outside and heard something heavy crunching leaves. He was surprised to see a large 8-9 foot figure standing under a security light watching him. HM described the creature as very large, around 500 pounds, arms past its knees, dark brown in color, a side view of a chest 1 ½ foot wide, with a slight \"beer belly\" The hair/fur was described as about 3-4 inches long and fluffy like. The head came to a point, sort of oval.  The witness whistled at the creature which turned to look at HM, then moved off to the wood line with a long stride. No vocals were heard and no tracks or other evidence was found.  The creature had been walking behind some trailers that sat close to the edge of the woods, near some trash dumpsters. It was apparently using the trailers for cover. His mother confirmed this event with me, although she didn\\'t see anything.The area has a 3 mile strip that is populated then turns into acres of timber.

Coming around a curve in the creek a splash came right in front of him. At first he believed the carp were jumping. Then three more splashes close by. The last appeared to be a rock. Slowing down he started looking in the direction the rocks came from. It was sitting on its knees much like a person. Upon standing up the creature and witness made eye contact for around 30 seconds. It appeared to be about 7ft tall and weighed around 400 + pounds. It had a shoulder width of about 3 1/2 ft. wide. The hair was a mix of black and gray along the lines of a raccoon. The hair length was approximately 4-5 inches in length; it was matted with mud up to the knees. It had an odor of fish and mildew. The head was conical, with an almost flat nose. The right hand that was wrapping around the tree as the creature was playing peek-a-boo was black. It appeared to be very stocky with little to no neck. After it was done watching the kayaker it turned and started running west through the woods. The witness stated that he is an avid coon hunter and has heard people walk through the woods. This did not bother to go around brush, it just went through it. After the encounter the young man had enough and paddled back to his truck. He returned that night to see if he could \\x93spotlight\\x94 it. After a while he thought he would try a howl, no response, at first. Then two wood knocks were heard. He knocked back and received a knock back from the distance. But nothing was seen.This all takes place next to a wildlife refuge.

Witness assumed it was the neighbor's two dogs who frequently roamed the area and would run up to him when he was around. He called the dogs names and the sounds stopped. He could see something black through the trees and bushes less then 100 ft from him. He could define arms that were very long when it turned. The movement was coming from very high up, about 7-8 feet off the ground. He was very alarmed, frozen in fear he managed to move forward a bit and the creature seemed to move around the tree as he moved like it did not want to be seen.

This route is driven by both witnesses daily. The hair was dark brown, long, shaggy and matted. The legs and hips were extremely thick and full of muscles. The height was estimated at seven feet and weight at 350 pounds with no fat noted. It crossed the road and into the woods in about three seconds.  It moved very fast, running left to right on two legs. It used its hands and arms to shield its face as it sprinted into the thick undergrowth and branches.

The son was alone and driving home during the second sighting. The creature was dark in color and about the same size as the one seen in 2011 with a thick back noted. The creature dropped down low and ran away into the woods on the left side of the road when the high beams hit it.The two witnesses went to the location of the two sightings the following day, found and photographed some possible formations made from small, twisted branches and broken branches on the ground. We have reviewed the photos, not enough detail is seen to determine whether or not they were made with hands or if the branches broke and the sticks fell that way naturally.In August of 2014 at 2 am, the son's friend drove up to his house and a biped could be seen walking inside a wood line behind the house.  It stepped behind a tree when the high beams were turned on.  Eye-shine was then seen peeking out to the left then right side of the tree, back and forth for about 20 minutes before the eye-shine disappeared.  The eyes were determined to be about 8 feet off the ground after inspecting the area with his friend the next day.  This happened about half a mile from the other two sightings.\"]\n",

       " <p><span class=\"field\">OBSERVED:</span> I and my cousin were walking down Harris River from the Harris River camp ground. We were walking about 30 to 45 minutes when my cousin thought he saw something standing in front of us about 100 feet or so away. When he asked me if I could see what it was, I told him I couldn't see because I didn't have any contacts on or glasses. So he told me it was just a stump so I was like ok.. Then we went over to where we thought the thing was and in the sand about an inch deep there was a footprint like a man's. In shoe size it looked like it might have been like a size 13 or 15, There were 3 foot prints and about a minute later we ran for about ten minutes and we started walking and then we got to the road, about a mile away from the picnic area, where we were having a Mother's Day picnic  We started to race each other to the picnic area where our family members were. Then we told them about it and we just kept it to ourselves for some odd reason.</p>,\n",

       " <p><span class=\"field\">OTHER STORIES:</span> No other incidents that I know of.</p>,\n",
       " <p><span class=\"field\">TIME AND CONDITIONS:</span> It happend in the daytime and if I was to guess it might have been 2 or 3 pm. </p>,\n",
       " <p><span class=\"field\">ENVIRONMENT:</span> There were 2 bridges nearby and we were on a river bank when the incident occured. Mountainous and forested terrain.</p>,\n",
       " <p>Follow-up investigation report by BFRO Investigator Dr. Wolf H. Fahrenbach:</p>,\n",
       " <p>The witness mentioned that the footprints were approximately 15\" long or slightly shorter. The three prints were not walking footprints but were close together. Since he personally could not get a good look at the initial sighting, the report has been classified as a function of the footprints.</p>]"

Though it was illegal to snowmachine in Anchorage, there were some good trails to ride on a little north of my house.\\n         <br/>\\n         <br/>\\n         We took off at probably 11 pm, rode up the road about a quarter mile, and cut off on the trails. It had snowed about 10 inches a few days before so there was fresh snow, with no tracks.\\n         <br/>\\n         <br/>\\n         I was leading the way for about a half hour, then we stopped and talked for a little bit.  We took off again and kept cruising on some sort of game trail that led to an opening in the woods.  I rode off into the opening with my friends following about fifty yards behind me.\\n         <br/>\\n         <br/>\\n         I came over this little mound and saw strange tracks leading to this spot in the snow where it looked like something had pushed aside some snow and layed down.  I figured it was just a moose or something.  But I followed the tracks over the next small hill and as I came down the far side my headlight pointed right on the back of a bigfoot.\\n         <br/>\\n         <br/>\\n         It was only about 10 to 12 feet in front of me.  It was running in the opposite direction.  I slammed on the brakes because I was scared out of my mind.  It continued to run away, jumped over a dead log covered in snow and disappeared into a group of trees and into the darkness.\\n         <br/>\\n         <br/>\\n         I was so surprised and scared I quickly turned around and rode back toward my friends. I met them back by the first mound and said \"We need to get out of here,\"  and rode back towards my house.  When I told them about it back near my house, they laughed and told me it was probably a bear or someone in the woods.  But I was 100% positive that is was not a bear or anything else.\\n         <br/>\\n         <br/>\\n         The way it was running through the deep snow made me sure that it wasn\\'t anything human.  For a long time I was made fun of and everyone told me I was crazy so I didn\\'t like talking about it.\\n        </p>\\n        <p>\\n         <span class=\"field\">\\n          ALSO NOTICED:\\n         </span>\\n         Some tracks in the snow, and a clearing in the fresh snow where it looked like a large animal had pushed snow aside and layed down.\\n        </p>\\n        <p>\\n         <span class=\"field\">\\n          OTHER WITNESSES:\\n         </span>\\n         My two friends were snowmachining behind me but did not see it. If it had been light outside they might have seen it, but it was pitch black outside.

Though it was illegal to snowmachine in Anchorage, there were some good trails to ride on a little north of my house.  <br/><br/>We took off at probably 11 pm, rode up the road about a quarter mile, and cut off on the trails. It had snowed about 10 inches a few days before so there was fresh snow, with no tracks.  <br/><br/>I was leading the way for about a half hour, then we stopped and talked for a little bit.  We took off again and kept cruising on some sort of game trail that led to an opening in the woods.  I rode off into the opening with my friends following about fifty yards behind me.  <br/><br/>I came over this little mound and saw strange tracks leading to this spot in the snow where it looked like something had pushed aside some snow and layed down.  I figured it was just a moose or something.  But I followed the tracks over the next small hill and as I came down the far side my headlight pointed right on the back of a bigfoot. <br/><br/> It was only about 10 to 12 feet in front of me.  It was running in the opposite direction.  I slammed on the brakes because I was scared out of my mind.  It continued to run away, jumped over a dead log covered in snow and disappeared into a group of trees and into the darkness.  <br/><br/>I was so surprised and scared I quickly turned around and rode back toward my friends. I met them back by the first mound and said \"We need to get out of here,\"  and rode back towards my house.  When I told them about it back near my house, they laughed and told me it was probably a bear or someone in the woods.  But I was 100% positive that is was not a bear or anything else. <br/><br/>The way it was running through the deep snow made me sure that it wasn't anything human.  For a long time I was made fun of and everyone told me I was crazy so I didn't like talking about it.  </p><p><span class=\"field\">ALSO NOTICED:</span> Some tracks in the snow, and a clearing in the fresh snow where it looked like a large animal had pushed snow aside and layed down.</p><p><span class=\"field\">OTHER WITNESSES:</span> My two friends were snowmachining behind me but did not see it. If it had been light outside they might have seen it, but it was pitch black outside.

The only light was the headlight from my snowmachine.</p><p><span class=\"field\">ENVIRONMENT:</span> In the middle of the woods, in a clearing covered in snow, with only small shrubs and bushes sticking out of the snow.

There was no snow on the ground yet. He said they looked at each other for a bit and he loaded his single shot shotgun cause he didn't know if it was friendly or not. He was going to run and tell the authorities but he didn't saying that they wouldn't believe him. He was very serious as he was telling the story. I know the man, he is a strong Christian.
